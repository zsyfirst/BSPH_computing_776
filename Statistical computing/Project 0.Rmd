```{r setup, include=FALSE}
install.packages( c("postcards", "usethis", "gitcreds") )

library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", user.email = "jane@example.org")
```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
