I am a MHS student in Epidemiology living in the 929 Apartment. I come from China, and just arrived in Baltimore for 2 weeks. I love hiking, eating spicy food. I am interested in the prevention of stroke and cognitive decline, which might result from poorly controlled CVD risk factors. I hope after my two years study life in John Hopkins, I could have good grasp of statistics and teamwork.
